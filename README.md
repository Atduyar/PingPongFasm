# PingPongFasm

**PingPongFasm** is a basic yet fully functional ping pong game developed in [FASM2](https://flatassembler.net/) using assembly language. This project showcases how to build a simple game with minimalistic code and efficient design while leveraging [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for graphics and input handling.

## Overview

PingPongFasm is a classic ping pong game implemented in assembly language with FASM2. It demonstrates the possibilities of low-level programming while providing a hands-on example of integrating a graphics library (raylib) into your assembly projects. The project is ideal for enthusiasts who wish to explore game development in assembly, understand hardware-level control, or simply enjoy a retro gaming experience.

---

## Prerequisites

Before building and running PingPongFasm, ensure you have the following installed:

- **FASM2 (Flat Assembler):** [Download FASM2](https://flatassembler.net/)
- **raylib 5.5:** The project includes the required raylib files in the `raylib-5.5` directory.
- **Make:** For Unix-based systems, or an equivalent build system on Windows.

*Note: Depending on your platform, you might need to adjust the Makefile or build scripts accordingly.*

---

## Installation and Build

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atduyar/PingPongFasm.git
   cd PingPongFasm
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   On Unix-based systems, simply run:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This command will compile the assembly source (`main.asm`) and link the raylib dependencies accordingly.

3. **Running the Game:**

   After successful compilation, run the generated executable:

   ```bash
   ./PingPongFasm
   ```

*For Windows users, adjust the build commands based on your environment or use a suitable IDE that supports FASM.*
